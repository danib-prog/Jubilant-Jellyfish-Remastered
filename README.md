# Jubilant Jellyfish Platformer Game - Remastered

This is the pygame version of https://github.com/Cheepsss/Jubilant-Jellyfish

The game was originally developed for a Code Jam, and the objective was to create something that connects to the theme "Think inside the box", and runs in the terminal. More on the game itself and the original project at https://github.com/Cheepsss/Jubilant-Jellyfish/blob/main/README.md .

The original game suffered from the incapability of terminals in running games, so I took it and remade the graphical part in pygame, and altered some of the backend code to fix bugs induced by migrating to a higher-resolution GUI.
